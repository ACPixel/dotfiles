# dotfiles

This is a ever-expanding collection of my personal dotfiles and config files.


## NeoVim
My NeoVim config uses [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for managing plugins, if you intend on using this config, please install Packer. (the config will attempt to do this for you on first boot but may not always succeed)
